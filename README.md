# B244006E_Analisis data Bike sharing

## Description
In the final project on Data Analysis in Dicoding, I analyzed the **bike-sharing** dataset. This analysis contains the process of Gathering data, Data wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, Visualization, and Conclusion. 
I also created a dashboard to display a graph that shows the trend of bike rentals on the **bike-sharing** dataset. [Dashboard](https://dashboardpy-b244006ebian.streamlit.app/). The complete analysis is contained in the file **B244006E_Submission_Analysis_Data.ipynb**
